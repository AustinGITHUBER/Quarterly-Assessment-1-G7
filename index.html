        <div>One, two, three<br>
            <br>
            Yeah, she's in love with the concept<br>
            As if we're all just how she imagined<br>
            'Cause we're in love but just don't know it yet<br>
            Well, tell me how I'm supposed to see the magic<br>
            <br>
            'Cause I don't believe in it no more<br>
            But I won't tell her<br>
            'Cause I always imagined<br>
            It's easier if she thinks she won<br>
            So Imma' let her<br>
            <br>
            And she said<br>
            "I don't think I love you no more."<br>
            "You never seem to call me lately"<br>
            Girl, I don't think you know me at all<br>
            'Cause I never thought I'd have to say this<br>
            <br>
            No, I don't love you, and I never did<br>
            Look at us burning down in flames for kicks<br>
            But just know<br>
            I'm not singing for your XO<br>
            I'm just singing 'cause it's over, yeah<br>
            (Uhh)<br>
            <br>
            Came and went like the summertime<br>
            Is that a sunset or sunrise?<br>
            Looking back like where'd the time go<br>
            So much for trying to keep this moving slow<br>
            'Cause I don't believe in her no more<br>
            But I remember<br>
            <br>
            How we talked shit like we knew what we wanted, and<br>
            I still remember what she said<br>
            <br>
            "I don't think I love you no more"<br>
            "You never seem to call me lately"<br>
            But I don't think she knew me at all<br>
            'Cause I never thought I'd have to say this<br>
            But I'm no liar<br>
            And I never hid anything<br>
            You should've seen it coming to this, just know<br>
            I'm not singing for an EX though<br>
            I'm just singing 'cause it's over<br>
            <br>
            Yeah, Yeah
